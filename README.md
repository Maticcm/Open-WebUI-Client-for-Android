# Open WebUI Client for Android

**Open WebUI Client for Android** is a simple, open-source Android wrapper application for accessing a self-hosted [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) instance. It provides a mobile-friendly interface to interact with your AI assistant directly from your Android device.
